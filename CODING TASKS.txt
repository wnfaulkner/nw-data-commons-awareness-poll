CLEANING
  -- Replace values in original data with text from response.options.tb (or at least make new variables)
  -- Remove rows in reshaped tables for those who didn't respond to a section/question because they weren't shown the infographic (currently "0. did not participate"). 
  -- In all tables, make "0. Did not participate" into NA so it exports blank into the final xlsx file (indicates that the person did not respond to the question because they did not get selected to see the infographics)
  -- Remove nationality (values are the same as 'country.of.residence')
- Create variables:
    -- Age group (decades)
    -- nationality.native (from country.of.birth); binary ='native' when person resides in country of birth, ='non.native' otherwise
    -- language.native (from language); binary ='english', ='other' otherwise
    -- Make sure q.id and q.num don't get exported with final tables
    -- Political.affiliation : standardize 'Dont know' & 'Don't Know'; add (UK) and (US) to all labels

ANALYSIS & STATISTICAL TESTS
  - Visualize differences in infographic vs. no-infographic by various demographic variables. For example, the graph on the next page displays the patterns of change in nuclear support among respondents from the main US political parties. For Democrats there is a clear leftward shift, but among Republicans the story is more complicated. Showing the infographic among Republican voters correlates with a shift shift from the edges (extremes) towards the center.
